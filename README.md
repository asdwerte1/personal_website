# My personal website
## Source code for my personal website/digital portfolio

This is being done for various reasons, but the main two are

- As a showcase of my achievement, experience and also just me
- As a personal project to practically implement CPD within technical skills

### Current development

- I am working on creating a personal blog page utilising a MERN stack and Docker
- I would like to create a dynamic "gallery" to showcase some of the amateur photography I do
- I want to update the functionality of my existing "To Do List", to make it have wider functionality, support multiple users, and use a more _"modern"_ approach
- I have been experimenting with the Spotify API in my spare time, and will likely incorporate onto the home page at some point in the future

### Tech stack

- SASS
- jQuery
- Bootstrap 5
